This repository contains a 2 SQL codes. \
One that creates all the tables within a database that I already had in SQL Server Management Studio. \
And the other is the SQL code that shows the work that I have done. \
All the SQL queries were initially done by looking at the enter table where all columns from the specific table were viewed. \
Not all the problems were done, I have only done the problems that were fundamental and allowed me to learn something new.
